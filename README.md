# Sunken Cost

## Introduction
Stop the enemies from reaching your boat! Rearrange your planks to keep them
away.

Selection screen:
Drag the cards from the market (bottom row) to your deck (top row). You can do
this after every battle. You can also remove cards from your deck by dragging
them back to the market. These cards become your planks in battle. You can
upgrade your cards by dragging an identical card on top of it. Cards can be
upgraded twice - but to upgrade the second time you need two upgraded versions.
You can lock cards in the market to save them for later.

Battle screen:
Hover over enemies with your mouse to see what they do (very important).
Each turn you can rearrange your planks by dragging them to a different
position. The button that looks like a play button is actually to fast forward
(sorry, bad ux design).

Good luck!
